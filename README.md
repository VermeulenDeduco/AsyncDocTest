# A Definitive Guide to Automated AsyncAPI v3 Documentation for MQTT-Based Microservices

This archive contains a structured example repository based on the outline you provided.
It includes:
 - `asyncapi/components/` (schemas, messages, traits)
 - `asyncapi/services/` (individual service AsyncAPI v3 documents)
 - `.github/workflows/asyncapi-docs.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow that validates, bundles, generates and deploys docs)
 - A short index and example files demonstrating patterns described in the guide.

Use this as a starting point and adapt component versions, hosts, and schemas for your environment.
